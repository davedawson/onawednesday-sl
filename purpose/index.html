    <p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
    <p>Today I’m meeting up with Dave in the morning to go out and get some interviews. Then I’m heading to work for most of the day. Tonight I’m going to see the US Open.</p>

    <p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
    <p>My favorite part of the day today is this morning while I’m taking photographs. It’s not my day-job, but it’s what I love to do, so any day that I get to take photos is a good day.</p>

    <p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I’m going to work, then the gym. The gym is my other favorite part of the day.</p>

    <p class="question">What are you doing today?</p>
    <p>Today I'm meeting up with Bekka around 8 a.m. at the Staten Island Ferry. We're going to ask a few people who are waiting for the ferry what they're up.</p>
    <p>I've got a few errands to run in midtown afterwards. Then I'll probably head to my studio in DUMBO to do a bit of work for the afternoon.</p>
    <p>I've got tickets to the US Open this evening, so I'll be peacing out of the studio a little early and heading to Queens to check that out with some friends.</p>

    <p class="question">What's your favorite part of the day?</p>
    <p>My favorite part of the day is early in the morning. I enjoy being up before my neighborhood gets going. I love when I see a few other people out that early too. It's like being in a secret club. We can nod at each other, knowing we're up before the rest of the city.</p>

    <p class="question">What are you doing tomorrow?</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I'm going surfing. A few friends and I are getting a Zipcar to head out to Rockaway beach to spend the morning surfing. Then I'll probably head into the studio for the afternoon and get some work done. I think I'm going to play some basketball in the evening too.</p>
